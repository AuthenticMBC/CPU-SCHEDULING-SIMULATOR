>>>CPU SCHEDULER SIMULATOR

>>This scheduler works good when all the processes inside the input file are arrange in their arrival time (First come on top & and last come at the bottom)Ex:
Burst_time:Arrival_time:Priority
5:0:3
4:1:2
3:1:1
4:2:2
3:3:1
5:4:3

>Maybe next time --> should handle input file that don't sort the processes according to their arrival time

>And also maybe later handle processes that arrived at the same time and then choose the one with short burst time 

>Also maybe later handler processes with same priority and choose the one that came first or the one with lower burst time.

> In priority scheduling --> Lower number indicate Higher priority
